    - Hey there I did get it. I was looking to be a manager if a position was open. I am a Asst GM for Frischs at the moment but if things over there can benefit me and your team I'll sit down and talk
    - No problem I will get her to drop off a resume to the 2980 island highway location thank you
    - We are interested but we cannot commit to a schedule at this time
    - I would be interested and I am available in a few hours to talk to her
    - I'm injured right now but interested in management..I used to work at that location
    - I would've loved to come to White Castle, however I'm already working a full time position. If there are positions available there than full time, I'd love to take advantage. If not I understand, sorry for the late responseX I had lost my phone and had to wait for a replacement
    - Hey if I'm interested in being a manager because I'm already serve safe certified and can prove that can I get a transfer with my same wages because I've been thinking of moving back to Corvallis for sometime but I currently am at the beacon location in Grants pass Oregon
    - Can I think about it? I would need to work around my schedule. I would love to come back.
    - Good Afternoon , I already work with White Castle at Newy 56 but would be interested in also taking shifts at the Bruckner location seeing as that is only 2 blocks away from my home . Let me know when I can talk with the manager and maybe we can figure something out !
    - sure, ill come back
    - YES. If you can pay me $25hr with a set schedule (opening) weekends off & NO MASK!
    - Yes I'm still interested in the position look forward to hear back from you thank you PERSON PERSON
    - yes obv
    - whatever sure
    - I can help turn that slow time around. I'm a born leader, I don't want to be manager to be a boss, I want to be manager because I have been in the restaurant industry for over 15 years and the customers are absolutely always right! This location here thinks otherwise so I can help turn everything around.
    - Hi, I'm PERSON.  I am interested in work.  but only from Monday to Friday from 5:00 am to 2:00 pm I already have a job for weekends and afternoons.  If you accept my schedule, I can start now.  contact me at this number thanks ...
    - I would like to but I was actually hired awhile back at your Ft. Oglethorpe location but took a job that paid more so.....I don't think I would be eligible.
    - Greetings I apologize for the late response, I did not see this messages before, I am still interested of working with White Castle but I'm an currently working in another job I could give you my hours and days off to see if I'm still the best candidate for this Job, also I would like to thank you for the opportunity.   Days off : Sunday and Mondays  Free hours : Tuesdays 1am to 8am                 Wednesday's 1am to 8am                 Thursdays 1am to 8am                   Fridays      9am to 2pm                   Saturdays   9am to 2pm
    - Sure the closest location to me is in canton ny.
    - I had worked at that location back in 2018 and I would love to speak about a shift leader position.
    - Hey how you doin mg buddy I would really love to the only reason I ha d to leave in the first place is cause my schedule I felt bad because Ik it's hard to work around
    - Rob:  thank you for reaching out as far as me. I worked at that store for four and a half years as a driver. I did five days and closed five days a week. (About 78 hours a pay period) I then went to the holly springs store where I had the same schedule until my health decevied me and had to back off. Right now I don't know what I can do as I still have issues (I'm 66) and I have an open door at holly springs. The best I can say is a maybe. Thanks Jim balazs

    - I sure would, I'm in florida until friday. Can we schedule for after?
    - Absolutely not, I have a management job that I really like. I worked at your location and was extremely disappointed by the restaurant manager. All friends I know have jobs they are happy with.

    - If this is really someone working with a hiring manager for Dunkin, I'd love another job, part time. But I don't like making coffee, especially the fancy drinks. I know I get stressed out when my orders wrong and I've had my share of that type of work as is. I love to clean though, and honestly every Dunkin I've been to could be cleaner or even a lot cleaner. There's usually a couple to three maybe four workers behind the counter and it gets really busy, not alot of time to actually maintain the place. So if there were a cleaning position, that was just a cleaning position I'd take that any day. Especially now with how the world is. But I don't see that happening, even when America runs on Dunkin. Thank you for the offer and have a great day!
    - Sure. $25 an hour, three days a week, fixed schedule. I've worked every non-manager position in a kitchen
    - My bad I'll still work i thought i had to work 10 hours
    - Yes However only during the week and only during the day part time. I dont know if that would fit into your schedule. Thanks for getting in touch with me.
    - I did but you're too busy for an interview so the PERSON constantly reschedules... 
    - yeah sure
    - that sounds good
    - Hi! I had already worked for that white castle and left but if you've got any part time positions for one or two days a week I might be interested
    - Thank you very much for your acknowledging my application, i am very much interested to join the team. i would just like to finish the finals week in my school hoping to be scheduled soonest available time. Have a blessed day
